			<h2>Lithium-Ion Segmented Cell</h2>
			<p>Lithium-ion batteries are arguably the most popular battery to date. The batteries are used in almost all portable electronic devices manufactured today and are dominating the rapidly growing electric vehicle market. There is also a potential for these batteries to play a large role in supplementing the growth of renewable energy and energy storage. As the climate crisis continues to worsen and public policy and technology are looking towards a solution, lithium-ion batteries are extremely important. These batteries work by allowing positively charged lithium ions to travel between the anode and the cathode through an electrolyte separator. Lithium-ion batteries are competitive against other batteries because they are fairly lightweight and are efficient in their number of charge cycles and their high energy and power density in comparison to other types of batteries.</p>
			<p>However, there are also some disadvantages to the lithium-ion battery. The durability and life cycle of the batteries are not up to par with the growing demands for electric vehicles. Previous research has shown that lithium-ion batteries exhibit inhomogeneous degradation due to factors such as temperature variations within the battery [1]. This can lead to a reduction in battery efficiency, lifetime, and even safety [2]. In order to improve upon future battery technology, we must have a better understanding of how and why the battery cells degrade as they are operating.</p>

			<p>This project focuses on the design of a new type of segmented cell. The segmented coin cells will be instrumented with microelectronic sensor components that will read current, voltage, and temperature gradients inside of the battery simultaneously, which has not been addressed in previous studies. To test the cells, they are to be wired in parallel to simulate a lithium-ion battery during operation. The sensors are daisy-chained together in order to acquire all cell data on one recording bus and will be assembled on a printed circuit board within the coin cells along with metallic foam layers to reduce any undesired current effects. By using low-cost microcomponents attached to one bus, the project is easily scalable and the data can be recorded and analyzed efficiently. Pouch cells will be used to test the sensor design, as they are more efficient than the comparable cylindrical cell in space efficiency and flexibility and are safer in the event of an explosion [3].</p>

			<p>For the prototype of the sensor design, equipment includes an Arduino Uno, one-wire temperature sensors, analog pressure sensors, a variety of spacers and metallic foams/springs, and programmable heating pads if needed to simulate temperature gradients. These sensors were well researched to ensure compatibility with the daisy-chain design implementation.</p>
			<p>This project has the potential to gain a better understanding of the conditions inside of working lithium-ion batteries which may lead to improvements in future battery designs for a longer life cycle. This would play an important role in advancing electric vehicle technology and climate policy.</p>
